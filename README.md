 Professional Portfolio Website

A clean, minimalist personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my professional experience, education, and technical skills with a focus on typography and smooth interactions.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Minimalist Design**: A "less is more" aesthetic that prioritizes content and readability.
-   **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically switches between light and dark themes based on your system preferences.
-   **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops.
-   **Smooth Interactions**:
    -   Intersection Observer API for "reveal-on-scroll" animations.
    -   Smooth scrolling for navigation links.
    -   Dynamic navigation bar that adjusts transparency on scroll.
-   **Modern Typography**: Uses the 'Inter' font family for a professional and contemporary look.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JS for animations and navigation logic.
-   **Google Fonts**: 'Inter' for streamlined typography.
